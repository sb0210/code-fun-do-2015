John Kerry Calls Nawaz Sharif  Is Promised 'Swift' Action On Pathankot  ,  Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif (AFP photo)Pakistan is "swiftly" carrying out investigations in a "transparent" manner into the terror attack on the air base in Pathankot and "will soon bring out the truth"  the country's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today told US Secretary of State John Kerry on a telephone call. "Kerry extended full support to the Prime Minister to find out the truth in the Pathankot terror incident " a statement issued by the Pakistan Prime Minister's Office said.Mr Sharif told Mr Kerry that "we are swiftly carrying out investigations in a transparent manner and will bring out the truth. The world will see our effectiveness and sincerity in this regard  the Prime Minister added " the statement said.Mr Kerry's call to Mr Sharif came amid Indian intelligence reports suggesting that Pakistani-based groups have planned and executed the strike on the Pathankot air base. Saying that Pakistan must deliver "prompt and decisive action" on the evidence provided  the Indian government has said without that  crucial talks between the Foreign Secretaries of both countries are unlikely to go ahead next week.Speaking on the talks  Mr Kerry said the US hopes that dialogue between India and Pakistan will continue despite the fact that terrorists have tried to thwart it.Mr Sharif said Pakistan would not allow anyone to use its soil to carry out terror operations abroad  the statement added.Earlier  a senior State Department official said in Washington that the US feels that time has come for Pakistan to walk the talk on the promises it made - both in public and in private conversations - that there would be no discrimination in its action against terrorist networks and bring the perpetrators of the Pathankot attack to justice.Seven military men were martyred and 20 others injured in the 84-hour operation launched last Saturday as six Pakistani terrorists attacked the Air Force base in Punjab's Pathankot.  ,  NDTV  ,  Pathankot learnings: India widely exposed to terrorism  even in best protected locations  ,  Hence the very large volumes of political commentary and analysis of our current 'policy' (if constant flip flops can be described as such) of continuing dialogue with Pakistan. (The author is executive director at the Institute for Conflict Management) As far as the possibility and potential of chemical  biological  radiological and nuclear terrorism (CBRN) is concerned  we have our heads buried deep into the sand  and rightly so  since we have not the faintest idea of what we are to do about these potential threats. But if this is the state of protection of major national strategic assets  the preparedness  or rather  unpreparedness  across the rest of the country can only be imagined.After each major terrorist attack  there are cries of anguish and emotional demands to know how this can happen despite more than 30 years of Pakistan sponsored terrorism on Indian soil  and despite India's even longer experience in countering terrorism and insurgency in various theatres. Supporters of the government have been eloquent in their advocacy of the sheer brilliance of the establishment in increasingly focusing the Indo-Pak dialogue on terrorism  and have projected the Pathankot attack as an 'opportunity' to present damning evidence to Islamabad of its own malfeasance.By this argument  we should celebrate each terrorist attack as another such opportunity  and look forward to continuing devastation on Indian soil so that we can continue to 'nail' Pakistan with our 'evidence'.  ,  Economic Times  ,  After Kerry calls up Sharif  Pakistan promises quick action  ,  Mr. Sharif also maintained the anti-terror commitment and said: Pakistan is swiftly carrying out investigations in a transparent manner and will bring out the truth. Pakistan is eliminating terrorism from its soil and will not allow any one to use Pakistani soil to conduct terror operations abroad. "Pakistan is swiftly carrying out investigations in a transparent manner. "In view of the growing doubt over the Foreign Secretary-level talks of January 15  U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called up Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Saturday to highlight the need to stay the course for dialogue. Earlier at a prime time interview  Pakistans Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry had reiterated that Pakistan will not allow terrorists to use its territory to launch attacks on the other countries.  ,  The Hindu  ,  Kerry asks Sharif to find out the truth in Pathankot attack  ,  Islamabad: US Secretary of State John Kerry today called up Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and asked him to find out the truth in the terror attack on the air base in Pathankot.

He just mumbled some vague nonsense about how intolerant and dangerous India is for his family and allowed it to be politicized  then stood by what he said without giving any clarification.  The political angle can be seen by even a blind man. Aamir saw yet agreed with it because unfortunately he has long been an Indian 'liberal' on the political spectrum.

After Jallikkattu  Tamil Nadu Body Seeks To Lift Ban On Toddy  ,  After Jallikkattu  Tamil Nadu Body Seeks To Lift Ban On ToddyIn the centuries-old festival of Jallikattu  which means "bull-taming"  bulls are let loose and young men compete to subdue them.

He said the movement had for the last 10 years been challenging those opposed to toddy to come for an open debate to prove that it was harmful  compared to Indian Made Foreign Liquor. The pongal festival would be complete only if Tamil Nadu government took steps to lift the ban on toddy  or else it should come forward for a debate with it  he saidNallasamy also sought to know from those fighting for total prohibition  whether they considered toddy as liquor  since they have a duty to enlighten people and also farmers on the evils of toddy.  ,  Business Standard  ,  Modi govt allowed 'Jallikattu' to please few political leaders of South: Congress  ,  New Delhi: Critising Modi's government's decision to allow the traditional Jallikattu or bull taming sport in Tamil Nadu during the festival of Pongal  Congress termed the move as a tactic to 'please few political leaders of South'. However  animal welfare groups have announced that they will challenge the union government's decision on Jallikattu ban removal. Many other Animal welfare associations have called the government's new notification "unconstitutional" and said that it goes against the spirit of the Supreme Court's order. While speaking to news agency ANI  senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said  To please few political leaders of South  govt has allowed this barbaric tradition.The entire state of Tamil Nadu erupted in joy as the central government yesterday lifted the the ban on 'Jallikattu'. People at places like Madurai and Trichy  where Jallikattu is traditionally held  were the most elated.  ,  Zee News  ,  Centre Lifts Ban On Jallikattu In Tamil Nadu  Order Angers Activists  ,  "Jallikattu is hugely popular in at least four southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Though the BJP has negligible presence in Tamil Nadu  many say this was seen an opportunity to earn a toehold in assembly elections. Last year  the event did not take place due to the court ban. The Animal Welfare Board of India  which had opposed lifting the ban  is likely to challenge the Centre's move. There were celebrations in Tamil Nadu's Madurai district on Friday after the Central government paved the way for lifting the ban on Jallikattu through a notification  despite the Supreme Court ban on the traditional Pongal sport of taming the bull.  ,  NDTV  ,  104What people don't understand is pluralism in India and how democracy works.   Beef was banned in Maharashtra not in Goa or Kerala. Because of people of Maharashtra were largely ok with it ( it was in manifesto of party that got elected )  while people in Goa and Kerala aren't.  People in TN want to torture bull as part of ancient tradition well its up to them. We can protest but its up to them.  You cannot reduce all hindus to a single generic one  ::  > People in TN want to torture bull as part of ancient tradition well its up to them.  This shows how much secular propaganda succeeds even with well-meaning folks. First and foremost  we do not "want to torture bulls". Pongal is not a sacrificial ritual.   Pongal is the three day harvest festival for Tamils. While on the first farmers thank Sun (nature  by extension)  the second day is reserved for thanking and worshiping cattle that helps in agriculture throughout the year. Cows and Bulls are bathed  decorated  served Pongal made with fresh harvest  and duly worshiped. Jallikkattu is part of this second day celebration.  Unfair methods are employed by some individuals to excite the animal  yes. Any government genuinely interested in animal rights can easily seek and get full cooperation from lots of reasonable folks. But making it sound like as if the farmers are some uncivilised brutes interested in torturing the animal is simply wrong.  ::  Absolutely. For more information on the reasons behind the jallikattu being held sacrosanct by a few sects check kamalhaasan's comments. If something like the bull run in pamplona or bull fighting in general in Spain is accepted as tradition and is celebrated why these double standards for the jallikattu?  ::  We are arguing two different points hence the difference in verbiage.   I am not commenting at all on Tamil Nadu or Farmer or tradition   my beef (;-)) was against the title. I was explaining why its not hypocrisy. Point was even if as part of ritual ( let's say naag panchami ) some animal was getting tortured center doesn't suddenly become responsible or hypocrite because of it   ::  Hindutva as an idealogy is almost non-existent in Tamil Nadu. What does Jallikattu have to do with it?   The author has a point about the Centre caving in for electoral gains but he is trying to distort the facts with his own political agenda by pretending Hindutva is to blame for this practice.  ::  There is no point of caving in for electoral gains. It is duty of govt to do what people desire. That's how democracy works.  ::  Do these secular liberals know Tamils worship their cattle with a dedicated festival called Mattu Pongal? And Jallikattu is part of that worship? Of course they do. But their aim to demonise the whole of Hindu traditions  Culture  societal and religious values as regressive. A practicing Hindu should be constantly humiliated about virtually every aspect of his faith (except the one that tolerates other faiths  of course) that he is always on the defensive. He should be sanitised with our liberal values so much  if he remains a Hindu he remains a Hindu in name only. Not in practice.   ::  I worship gaumatha by consuming her flesh. Please let me worship in peace.  ::  Basically what these animal rights activists do is making it impossible for the farmer to raise naive breeds unless he is willing to lose his livelihood for them. (Sort of what communists do to industry.) Resulting in native breeds that withstood  nay thrived under  Hindoo "cruelty" for millennia  dying out. Liberals' point is: but they are dying out "in dignity". They are apparently giving "dignity" to Bulls that are fucking *worshipped* by Tamils.  ::  But then  One True God deserves worship. Not cows or bulls or motherland. Fucking heathens never get the point.   ::  So its OK to kill cattle if its Hindus killing it?  Just confused.  I am for eating beef. I also accept that Hindu farmers have been getting rid of their cattle  for slaughter  forever. And native breeds thrived under that.  But then where is the beef ban plans coming from? They are not coming from liberals.  You seem to be thoroughly convinced about something. I have no idea what. Animal rights activists are not largely liberals  they are a mix of vegans and right wingers. Liberals want to eat the cow. Animal rights activists and the right wing want to go to a place where no cow is killed  leading to overall less cows and cattle.  ::  >So its OK to kill cattle if its Hindus killing it?  Who's killing them?  ::  Its a question to LordIshant. His basic point  over multiple posts  is that HIndus know what they are doing whether its beef ban or jallikkattu  and no one should tell them anything. Hence the question to him.   ::  I have given my comment in two (or three) parts specifically to avoid confusion. First part about secular liberals and second part about animal rights activists. Yet you are confused? And that is my fault?   ::  No one is being humiliated... But barbaric tribal activities which are not in tube witbt the morals of today should not be supported by the govt... Why don't u argue for the unbanning of the sati system if ur that proud of all ur Hindu traditions... It's quite disgusting that the "liberals" banned that sacred Hindu act isn't it?   ....pathetic  ::  Sati was practiced among certain sections of Hindus and they will be better equipped to explain the societal  cultural and political aspects of that practice. But if my memory serves right  it is the Hindus among that section who led the campaign to stop it. Hinduism has always reforms/renews itself. No dearth of enlightened beings such as Narayana Guru in Kerala or Viveananda in Bengal or Sahajananda in TN. That is my whole point. Sati and caste are favourite secular sticks to beat all of Hindus  eh?  ::  Sati practise started among Hindu royal families and warrior families because when their husbands died and the war was lost  the enemies took the wives as trophies/raped them. It was a social practice and not a religious one.  ::  That was jauhar  ::  > Jallikattu is part of that worship?   So we worship by torturing animals? Are you saying that our great Hindu tradition teach us to laugh while animals are being tortured and believe that somehow this will bring good fortune for us? It doesn't seem like the Hinduism that i was taught about  and certainly not the one that can be found in books.  Can you give me source from Hindu scriptures that legitimizes this practice? Or general principles of hindu ethics that can be used here to justify this tradition.        ::  Ah. Here comes a classic *secular* Hindu who thinks he can read a bunch of books and be an authority on all matters Hindu. Hinduism does not work like "secular" faiths  my friend. No reason to justify the practice of thousands of years old based on books you've read or scriptures you were taught about. Here an enlightened being can still write a book in English in 2016 and a section of Hindus can adopt that book as their scripture overruling all other millennia-old scriptures. No scripture "you were taught about" is the Final Revelation to stop that from happening.   What our great Hindu tradition teaches is context-sensitiveness. If you were not taught about Sangam poetry  classical Tamil literature  innumerable folk tales about community heroes and rural Gods of southern Tamil Nadu  that is not a shame. Even the most fanatical Jallikkattu supporter is not asking his sport be celebrated across India by all Hindus.  ::  This is a remnant of tribal festival whose essence is incompatible with the ethics taught in Bhagwat Gita. If you want to celebrate this madness disguised as festival and the state allows it then by all means do so. But don't call it Hindu festival. Don't disrespect Hinduism and life-affirming values of vedas and gita by associating this demonic  primitive savagery with them.   If only you could see this 'tradition' in light of *Dharma*  you would have at once abandoned it. But you are blind to the notion of 'tradition' and you lack courage to stand up before 'tradition' in favour of *Dharma*. You are not hindu  you are a demon-worshiper  raksha.  ::  Bhagavad Gita or no Hinduism? Hahaha!   http://i.imgur.com/8QehUZx.jpg  (By your definition  I won't be a Hindu  and Christianity and Islam would be larger religions than Hinduism in India.)  ::  Faith is not some number-game. One true hindu equals millions of meeks whose faith is clouded by lust and ignorance and whose spirit is bounded by blind adherence of tradition.   ::  One True Hindu? Like One True God?   ::  One true hindu like Vivekanada who go by words and spirits of scripture and they are willing to abandon part of their own 'tradition' if it goes against those. Such one fellow is greater than millions of masses and by virtue of his loyalty to eternal principles and not to transient traditions  he stirs rest towards Hinduism.  ::  Towards Hinduism? Hinduism is up there somewhere away from "millions of masses" in the Vedas and Bhagavad Gita?  ::  Hinduism is the truth. People fail to know this truth because of ignorance. Sages such as Vivekananda remove this ignorance and reveal to us the truth and eternal principles that was always within our reach.  ::  We Hindus are not islamists. 'One true xxx' shit doesn't work on us. If you believe bhagwat gita and that it applies for jallikattu etc  good for you. Those who think bhagwat gita is red herring here  good for them. Bhagwat gita is a part of Hinduism. Hinduism is much larger.   ::  Hinduism is not some mumbo-jumbo that can mean anything. You can't justify each and every action by twisting the great lessons of Hinduism. In Hinduism there is clear-cut demarcation between what is dharma and what is adharma. This primitive savagery goes against those eternal principles and thus it must be abandoned at once.  ::  FYI  the Vedas  which are considered the basis of Hinduism  talk of animal sacrifice. Also  it's upto individual to give up a practice because of belief  not through government bans.  , 0.269499693202 ,   There is no point of caving in for electoral gains.

The odd-even rule may have failed at pollution but scored in traffic management  ,  "For the last one week or so the experience of travelling on Delhi roads appears different from what it used to be. "Yes  it happens sometimes " says Sharma.But the fire force chief is in a better mood these days after the Delhi government implemented the odd-even scheme of staggering car traffic. Pollution levels are still well in the hazardous range but if the odd-even scheme has yielded benefits accruing from decongested roads  it may well be time to say: well begun is half done. Negotiating through the dense traffic was a nightmare and it is also something we had become used to " says Sharma.
