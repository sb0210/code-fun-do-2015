This is a very simplistic explanation and there's a lot of nuance I'll leave out  but it'll give you an idea. A stock is a small part of a company. When you buy a stock  you are essentially a partial owner of the company. Companies issue stock to raise money  either for the current owners or for big project that they plan to take on in the future. So  your corner store owner can decide that he wants to take his company "public" and sell 50% of his stake in his store to random strangers for a certain price. In turn  these random strangers can sell their pieces to other people.   A stock exchange is a bunch of these people voting with their wallets on how much they think companies should be worth. That's determined by how much money the company makes  how much people think it'll make in the future  and also a few other factors that we won't touch.   When you make an investment  you want to make a profit. If you lend someone a $1000  you may ask for an interest in return  so in a year they have to pay you back $1100. Similar idea with stock - when you buy a stock you do with the idea that you'll make a profit. You think that the value of the company will increase. So  you expect the price of the stock to go up. In order for that to happen  you obviously have to buy a stock when it's price is low  and sell it when its price is high.   Now  when the market drops  prices of stocks of companies that are traded on that market fall. This happens for many reasons  like investors thinking that the economy will be bad and all companies will do poorly  so all companies will lose money and their stocks drop.   If you are very smart or more likely very lucky  you can figure out when the prices are lowest  and buy stocks. When the stock price goes up  you sell and make money. For example  if the economy starts doing better after a recession  companies will make more money  so their stock will go up.   Again  this is very simplistic and high-level  but I hope you get the gist of it.   ::  I didnt mean to ask a stupid question   genuinely didn't know which is why i asked . I feel bad for asking now  I didnt know this was something I should know.   But I am extremely thankful to you and many others for explaining to me this.

Again   thanks a lot .   ::  Yeah  don't feel down; dumb people downvote stuff that asks questions about things they already know  rather than helping share information.  You're totally in the right to asked the questions and sustained your curiosity.  ::  I think other people have already explained why you want to buy low and sell high.  Obviously that makes you money.  The problem is that it's hard (or maybe impossible) to predict which way stocks will head in the future.    So there are two methodologies that people tend to follow.  They see stocks rising to high levels  and basically say "I want to get on that rocketship  and make money like everyone else".  Sometimes this works  sometimes the stock comes crashing back down.    Other  contrarian investors (which I consider myself)  tend to buy stocks when they are doing poorly.  Why? because sometimes the market behaves irrationally.  For instance  I see potential opportunities investing in Oil now (which has been destroyed by low oil prices).  I see potential opportunities in Chipotle (hurt by health/investigation issues).  And I see potential in the overall stock market  now that it's taken a big hit for the year.    ::  When you bet on a stock in trouble because they are in the news you are gambling they will recover. As always they call it investing but it is gambling and be careful if you invest/gamble money you need to pay the bills and live.   ::  This is one of the goals of maintaining a balanced portfolio.  In a simple sense  imagine you aim to diversify by having 20% of your money in each of A  B  C  D  and E...At the end of the year  maybe A and B did well  C and D did poorly  while E was neutral.  Your portfolio (by assets) might now be 25% A  25% B  15% C  15% C  and 20% E.   Rebalancing would be to sell off some A and B  to buy more C and D  getting back to your 20% across the board target.  It has the side effect of always selling assets that have been overperforming (presumably high) while buying the ones that underperformed (presumably low).  ::  If you buy stocks when they're low  you can make a lot of money on the  rebound. As opposed to somebody who might just break even on it because they owned the stock before it lost value.  However it is a risky strategy  as there's no guarantee that a given stock will regain its former value.  ::  Who would have thought Kodak would have gone bankrupt.

Going long refers to buying into a position which remains open pending an offsetting sale vs. short which is selling a position which remains open pending an offsetting purchase. Basically "long" is just the opposite of being "short" of stock.  EDIT: Basically think of this way; Short = I have cash  but I'm "short" of stock that I owe my broker. Long = I bought stock  but now I don't have cash.  ::  Long you are broke until you sell the stock or it becomes worthless. You may have bought 1000 shares of Berkshire Hathaway when it was about $12 in 1964 and was at more than $200 000. On paper you RICH but can not pay your rent unless you sell a share if you did not have other income.   ::  This is an interesting thing to say. It seems likely that "long" in reference to stocks originated that way  but your comment seems to imply that everyone buys into a stock to hold which isn't true.  It may seem counterintuitive  but you can buy into a long position while intending to hold for a very short period of time if you expect a short term uptick in the stock.  I think it's important to make the distinction that the primary use of "long" and "short" in investing refers to what side of the transaction you're on.  The long position is ownership of the stock  wherein an increase in stock value is a win; alternatively you can be in a short position where you're selling a borrowed stock and therefore make money if you can replace that borrowed stock at a cheaper price (value decreases).  Technically  though  I could hold a short position for a greater period of time than a long position.  Sorry  I just saw your comment and wanted to split hairs. The etymology of longs and shorts could certainly be the time period they were typically held for  but those terms don't necessarily refer to time frame anymore but whether or not you own or are borrowing the stock.  ::  thx investopedia  i think the guy was just trying to make a joke  ::  You've never heard "buy low  sell high"?  ::  No unfortunately   i can only assume that's a bad thing.  .  ::  you're an idiot  ::  No he's not.

Basically "long" is just the opposite of being "short" of stock.  EDIT: Basically think of this way; Short = I have cash  but I'm "short" of stock that I owe my broker.

It seems likely that "long" in reference to stocks originated that way  but your comment seems to imply that everyone buys into a stock to hold which isn't true.  It may seem counterintuitive  but you can buy into a long position while intending to hold for a very short period of time if you expect a short term uptick in the stock.  I think it's important to make the distinction that the primary use of "long" and "short" in investing refers to what side of the transaction you're on.  The long position is ownership of the stock  wherein an increase in stock value is a win; alternatively you can be in a short position where you're selling a borrowed stock and therefore make money if you can replace that borrowed stock at a cheaper price (value decreases).  Technically  though  I could hold a short position for a greater period of time than a long position.  Sorry  I just saw your comment and wanted to split hairs. The etymology of longs and shorts could certainly be the time period they were typically held for  but those terms don't necessarily refer to time frame anymore but whether or not you own or are borrowing the stock.  ::  thx investopedia  i think the guy was just trying to make a joke  ::  You've never heard "buy low  sell high"?  ::  No unfortunately   i can only assume that's a bad thing.  .  ::  you're an idiot  ::  No he's not.

Anti-migrant protest turns violent as German welcome cools  ,  Shortly before Saturday's protest began  Merkel hardened her stance towards migrants  promising expulsion for criminals and a reduction in migrant numbers over the longer term to Germany. Police said around 1 700 people attended the rally organised by the far-right anti-Islam PEGIDA movement  which has seized on the alleged involvement of migrants in the Cologne attacks as proof Merkel's policy is flawed. The attacks  ranging from sexual molestation to theft  shocked Germany  which took in 1.1 million migrants and refugees in 2015 under asylum laws championed by Chancellor Angela Merkel  despite fervent opposition. COLOGNE - Riot police broke up far-right protesters in Cologne on Saturday as they marched against Germany's open-door migration policy after asylum seekers were identified as suspects in assaults on women on New Year's Eve.  ,  Ynetnews  ,  Cologne New Year sex assaults are a wake-up call: all women have the right to feel safe  ,  German far-right supporters demonstrate at Cologne`s train station (Reuters)It is this aspect of the Cologne assaults which has caused the greatest outrage.

Even Merkel hasnt quite got it  talking last week about the feeling women had of being at peoples mercy. In that 2008 study almost 63 per cent of the Egyptian men interviewed openly admitted they had harassed women. Rape and sexual assaults are not unknown in European cities but organised sex attacks by gangs in public spaces are a new and terrifying phenomenon.  ,  The Independent  ,  Merkel Calls for Tighter Laws on Convicted Migrants  ,  0:47The Ehang 184: Taking the Drone Up a NotchThe Ehang 184  the world's first autonomous helicopter drone  was unveiled this week at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

Volker Bouffier  the prime minister of the state of Hesse  told the meeting: Cologne has changed everything. However  as one source present at the meeting reported to Der Spiegel  Merkel was quick to point out: I can do the maths. Germanys chancellor  Angela Merkel  has proposed tougher laws that would make it easier to deport migrants after a wave of sex attacks in Cologne that were allegedly carried out by asylum seekers  an incident she is reported to have described as a bombshell. CDU party members repeatedly insisted that the New Year attacks marked a sea change in attitudes to Germanys open-door policy  which has seen around 1.1 million refugees arrive over the past 12 months.  ,  The Guardian  ,  65***"It's about making clear that we will not stop moving around freely here in Cologne  and to protest against victim bashing and the abuse of women " said 50-year-old city resident Ina Wolf.***  This sounds like the voice of women's rights from decades ago.

And so the reason why neither the Greeks nor the Etruscans had any interest in Latium would be....? The Tiber river valley might have been better suited to agriculture than a barren rock in the middle of the Atlantic  but it was one of the least productive parts of the Roman Empire.  Egypt  Syria  and Anatolia were the breadbaskets of the empire  and in Italy Sicily was considered to be vastly more productive than the areas around Rome.  (The fertile farmland the Greeks colonized in the western Med was around Naples  Sicily  around Marseilles  and eastern Spain.)

Given that Rome was a group of seven villages built on rocky hills in the middle of a swamp  the answer is clearly not geography.  Note that the same dynamic happened again.

I don't understand why European countries are having such issues. That's not an indictment  it's a sincere bewilderment. Over here in the "new world" we have entirely invented national identities which are largely crafted upon the notion that all of us (aside from the native Americans) are immigrants; some from desperate histories (such as the Irish were  and the Polish  the Vietnamese  Chinese  etc.) Some immigrants come from good places and histories too  but despite these matters  there's a largely accepted notion that once a person becomes an American citizen  they are American. They get the apple pie and baseball  the flag and Elvis  and they contribute to this crazy noisy but unified  culture.  And I can't help but wonder what it is which makes that harder in Europe. Is it because America is huge and surrounded by huge oceans  so we can more practically isolate? Is it because we're all immigrants  so we lack a sort of ethnic identity? Is it because we have that constitution with its rule about there being no laws in favor or against religion? Is it because we are just kind of consensually materialistic instead of idealistic?  Or is it something about Europe? Is it because European nations share many borders and so are more difficult to isolate? Is there some vestige of colonialism which too-handily perceives immigrants as an underclass or cheap labor? Is it simply Europe's astonishingly rich history  with all its rightful cultural pride amid the burden of preserving and defending that?  You see? It's just perplexing to me  over here. We have people in America who are ethnic nationalists too  but they are largely seen as racist or xenophobic.  I'd really like some clear answers on this because what Europe is experiencing here  which I see on Reddit every day  seems like a problem that I can't appreciate the reason for. Because I don't understand it. It seems like a huge  muddled mix of issues with deep intractable roots  too large and complex to be viewed with the simplicity of an American perspective on immigrants.  **EDIT:** I will upvote anyone who answers this because I value your thoughts no matter what they are. As we say in America  "I may not agree with your words but I defend your right to speak them."  A thought: Sometimes I am moved to reflect on how lucky I am to be here  where we tried to erase history and [become something new](http://youtu.be/XdC6thlCAlI)  as foolish as that may be.  ::  We were mostly anglo saxon protestant  that is to say western civilization  when it mattered. Some Dutch were absorbed. when the irish and the germans came that was still western civilization  and the irish were the only catholics in any numbers we had and we had 100 years of development before they arrived in numbers. That informed our traditions and our government. As long as we are not swamped  it can continue. In places where there has been mass immigration and entire communities are one or two generations old you see many problems with corruption. Doesn't matter the race.   ::  A lot of it is due to Old World-New World distinctions imo. Consider most nations in Asia and Europe.  A lot have ethnic and cultural histories.  Sure  one can assimilate culturally but an ethnic German or Chinese or Vietnamese will be more connected to their respective countries.  I mean  consider what we call these countries.  For example  Italy.  Unless Italian ceases to be an ethnic distinction or unless we wipe away their history and change their country name to "piece of land shaped like a boot"  native Italians will be more "Italian" than anyone else.    Now consider multiethnic countries in Asia and Africa.  Laundry list of problems.  Middle east is full of Shia and Sunni divisions within countries.  African countries with various ethnicities grouped together with artificial border generate internal strife.  It's strange to hear people blame post-colonial strife in the Middle East and Africa on artificial borders grouping clashing ethnicities together and support policy that would make the rest of the Old World ethnostates a bunch of multiethnic states with arbitrary borders.    Anyway  the New World  i.e. the Americas and Australia  is different.  Sparsely populated due to disease and ethnic cleansing  only the native Americans and aboriginals have that kind of tie to the land.  It's a place where we truly can have multicultural and multiethnic states and we can make them work.  It'll be off their backs  i.e. the destruction and displacement of the native culture and people  but those crimes can't be undone at this point  only assuaged.  Imo  these processes shouldn't be repeated in the Old World though even if the cultural and ethnic displacement is encouraged with incentives and ideology in contrast to the violence used in the New World.  ::  The answer is Islam.  ::  In America a Syrian can immigrate  become a citizen  and be considered 100% American by his peers. Apparently this is not the case in many parts of Europe. In Europe even folks that were born there to immigrant parents are often called foreigners. That's absolutely not going to work if they want these people to integrate better.  ::  America doesn't have centuries of history and tradition as Europe does. A French person could possibly trace back to ancestors from a time when the land was called "Gaul". An American  if not native american  would end up tracing out of this land to another land. By the time America became a nation  it was diverse and continued to be diverse.  Thus diversity is the American tradition.  ::  13 colonies weren't particularly diverse compared to France I780 actually.  ::  In the early days of America  there were individual societies of Italians  French  British  Polish  etc..  It took several generations for them to integrate out of individual class structures.  The goal was to become Americans.  The difference is that these immigrants want the social benefits of Europe but rebuild their third world culture inside of Europe.  They don't want to be Germans or French  they want to be Syrians.  ::  good  hopefully this is beginning of the end of Merkel and her insane immigration policy  ::  wait  those criminal complaints weren't about the sexual assaults. a group opposing the government's opinions was protesting against the assaults in cologne and some of the protesters were taken into custody. this won't do anything to merkel  rather strengthen her support because she takes care of "nazis". most of the people in germany still believe in "refugees welcome".  ::  The protest was arranged by members of a far right group that people see as racists. Along with not wanting the refugees they also want all Muslims out of the country. The problem with these groups is they go to far and should focus on what's possible instead of expecting what isn't. They should have worked with other groups to develop a turnout for a protest and stick to one message. Average people who are outraged are less likely to back ideas also being said by groups like this for fear of being labeled.   , 0.469446315631 ,  It's almost like everything SJWs want is actually counterproductive in the long run.. ,  good  hopefully this is beginning of the end of Merkel and her insane immigration policy

President Obama  too  vowed "to urge high-tech and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice.

And so when politicians make requests of tech companies  it's that much harder to convince the tech firms to say yes. That tension has become most obvious in the back-and-forth over encryption  and whether tech companies should give law enforcement greater access to protected communications. (EPA/Olivier Douliery / POOL)Here's the basic problem the government faces when it comes to stopping the Islamic State's Internet propaganda: It needs Silicon Valley's help. That's why simply "asking" for Silicon Valley's help in fighting ISIS is way more complex than it sounds.  ,  Washington Post  ,  US Seeks Help Of Silicon Valley Companies To Combat Terrorism  ,  Top officials of the Obama administration have met leading Internet companies in Silicon Valley in an effort to build cooperation with them in combating online radicalisation and recruitment by terror groups. "This engagement is a result of that call. "This meeting is the latest in the administration's continuing dialogue with technology providers and others to ensure we are bringing our best private and public sector thinking to combating terrorism " a senior administration official said after the meeting was over in San Jose yesterday.The meeting was attended by the White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough  Assistant to the President for Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security Lisa Monaco  US Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith  among other senior administration officials.Representatives of a number of leading Silicon Valley companies including Google  Facebook  Yahoo and Microsoft attended the meeting.The meeting comes after Barack Obama's call in his address on December 6 for government and technology community to work together to combat terrorism and counter violent extremism online. The administration is committed to taking every action possible to confront and interdict terrorist activities wherever they may occur  including in cyberspace " the official said.Earlier in the day  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest  said the goal of the engagement was to find additional ways to work together to make it even harder for terrorists or criminals to find refuge in cyberspace.Earnest said this was an opportunity to be a robust discussion about ways they can make it harder for terrorists to leverage internet to recruit  radicalise  and mobilise supporters to carry out acts of violence.Earnest said there was precedent for this kind of cooperation with tech companies  when they had worked together to combat child pornography and hoped to find common ground with them"Many of these technology companies that are participating in the meeting today are run by patriotic Americans who don't have any desire in seeing their technology being used to aid terrorists  or make it easier for terror organisations to recruit followers and incite them to carry out acts of violence " he said.  ,  NDTV  ,  34Its a very fine line to get that information  said Andre McGregor  a former FBI terrorism investigator and now director of security at Tanium Inc  a Silicon Valley security company.

Our 4th amendment rights can be easily defeated by companies willingly handing data over.  If they don't  they get screwed like ex Qwest CEO Nacchio.  We need to make it illegal to hand over anyone's data without their prior consent or warrant from an elected court (not an appointed one).  ::  probably bribed AND threatened.. effective combination.  ::  You're gonna make this back door or else  AND we're gonna pay you whether you want it or not... I'd probably do it also   ::  From the article:  >In Washington earlier  White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters many of these technology companies that are participating in the meeting today are run by patriotic Americans and would want to cooperate.  When there is an implied differentiation as to the characterization of anything or anybody that uses the term *patriotic* or *patriot* I cringe. It reeks of coercion and propaganda.  >It wasnt all agreement. At another point  Apples chief executive Tim Cook told the government it needs to *state publicly* that it supports strong encryption.  *emphasis mine.  That said  that's an odd choice of wording.  >The government also appears conscious of the risks. In the briefing document sent to tech executives before the meeting it asked if any terrorist content flagging system were clearly independent from government involvement  would that increase its viability.  This actually sounds somewhat promising. Any legislation would eventually result in egregious overreach  as has been proven with basically  all legislation. I'd rather not see any laws that would be ultimately used against me and millions of other users once they ran out of convenient terrorists.  I'm concerned  but I'm reserving judgement. They're not saying so  but screwing with encryption would screw with commerce.  >They also face competing demands from different US officials. Public-facing politicians  such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  the respective Democratic and Republican presidential frontrunners  have called on technology companies to effectively kick terrorists off the internet. Thats impossible  the companies respond.  Why  for the love of god  do we continue to allow technologically incompetent people in office? It doesn't take that long to get a decent overview of how these things work and failing that  find appropriate advisors.
