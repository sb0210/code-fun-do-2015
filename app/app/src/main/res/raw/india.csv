Facebook fights back in row over its free internet for Indias poor  ,  In an editorial in the Times of India  Mark Zuckerberg  Facebooks co-founder  argued that free internet access was a basic human right. The regulator will give its decision on whether Facebooks Free Basics plan will be allowed in India at the end of January. We dont believe [net neutrality] was ever intended to deprive poor people of the opportunity to experience the benefits of basic internet services. In the past week  more than 2.4 million Indians have written to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India as a row escalated over Facebooks Free Basics initiative. The campaign  backed by full-page advertisements in national newspapers  urged Indians to submit a pre-prepared form saying they were in favour of Free Basics to the telecoms regulator.  ,  The Guardian  ,  Fewer Likes for Free Basics  ,  A majority of respondents in an online survey say they are opposed to Facebooks Free Basics initiative and support net neutrality. Keywords: Facebook  Free Basics The survey by community network LocalCircles of 30 000 people shows 81 per cent of the 14 000 who responded to the question on Free Basics voted against it. They want the government to provide free access to the Internet for essential services such as news  emergency alerts and education  either in partnership with telecom providers or independently. About 78 per cent of the 15 000 respondents do not want private players to act as a gateway to the Internet.  ,  The Hindu  ,  Zuckerberg Plea for Free Web in India Wins Support in Review  ,  Facebook Chairman Mark Zuckerberg last month made a personal appeal in one of Indias leading newspapers for the country to allow a free Internet service. A majority of Indians who submitted comments to the nations telecommunications regulator said they support Facebook Inc.s Free Basics plan that would allow free Web access. Yet activists say the program threatens the principles of net neutrality and could change pricing in India for access to different websites. Facebooks CampaignTo drum up support  Facebook started a Save Free Basics In India campaign  asking Indian users to support digital equality by filling out a form that was sent as an e-mail to regulators. It received 544 000 responses from @facebookmail.com  with most backing Facebooks plan  the regulator said.  ,  Bloomberg  ,  Net Neutrality: Telecom operators back differential pricing for data services  ,  "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has received around 24 lakh comments on its consultation paper on differential pricing for data services  a key aspect of net neutrality. In a joint representation submitted to telecom regulator Trai through industry bodies COAI and AUSPI  operators have said differential pricing schemes should be non-discriminatory. In its submissions to Trai  the industry bodies in a joint letter said  "For the growth of data service  price differentiation for data services can be allowed. "Such differential tariffs for voice have only enhanced the affordability of telecom services in India. New Delhi: Telecom operators have supported differential pricing for data usage for accessing different websites  applications or platforms as they feel it is critical for promoting innovation in the Internet eco-system and bringing more people online.  ,  Firstpost  ,  61Its also weird to see lots of freebasics supporters here nowadays.  ::  I support free basics ergo facebook paid me. Dumb logic.  ::  >I suppose free basics ergo facebook paid me. Dumb logic.    Where did I say that??  ::  It was supposed to be support not suppose. And it is not necessarily for you. I misunderstood your comment. However  I see a lot of redditor crying paid shills whenever they see someone making an argument in favor of Free Basics.  ::  I SUPPORT FREEBASICS.  ::  I am not surprised seeing your account is 5 days old  ::  Religious books are more credible because they are old.  ::  A lot of them are unpaid  they just gobble up propaganda from facebook on facebook and regurgitate it. People are extremely gullible in general.  ::  Have you ever considered you might be the gullible one falling for the propaganda.  ::  Which propaganda would that be ?  ::  The one you have fallen for that no matter what Free Basics is bad.  ::  freebasics is shit and zuckerberg is shit . fucking cucold prick he is.  ::  Look at this intelligent comment.  ::  That is very common from them.  ::  I barely participate in net neutrality threads on /r/india and I don't really have strong feelings on the subject.  But it's obvious to anybody that Facebook is in it primarily for profit  and wants to game the lack of proper regulation India has for net neutrality and unfair competition. It's also clear they're spending tons of money on a propaganda campaign.  ::  > It's also clear they're spending tons of money on a propaganda campaign.  I agree with this one. But it can just be a media campaign not a propaganda campaign.  Whethere FB is in it for profit  doesn't make it it bad. How exactly is it bad? People say NN and some shit like that but how exactly is it going to harm people?  ::  If you're familiar with anti-trust cases  it's a bit like that. Facebook can use the platform of internet.org/freebasics to control a very large market quite unfairly.  The thing is India doesn't have proper legislation yet  so facebook is just utilizing that.  Let's say google is a rival to facebook. Facebook can just choose to not allow facebook on its platform. You would be forced to choose their shitty search engines. The govt needs to make sure adequate anti-trust/anti-competitive protections are in place so that doesn't happen.  Other people will probably be able to articulate this better than me.  ::  But doesn't that make governments problem? They have to bring in legislation to encourage such things. As of now FB allows anyone to put their stuff in free basics if they agree to certain terms and conditions like keeping media size small etc. That is very reasonable limitation. I can understand the fear that in future FB might not allow rivals on its platform but that can be true for any platform  for Android  iOS  windows  Mac OS  Amazon  Flipkart  Zomato  yelp. Absolutely any kind of service that is a two way platform. Should we stifle all of that?  > You would be forced to choose their shitty search engines.  How is that? It is only people who have no connection at all who will be forced to use their shitty search engines. If you have internet you can use whatever you want. They even changed their name from internet.org to free basics to depict what exactly their service is. As long as they are allowing any service in barebones format to be on their platform  they are not violating net neutrality. They have even agreed to allow third parties to vet the apps that come on free basics. What more can they do? I think it is more transparent and neutral than majority of the services we receive in India. The reason everyone is jumping on the bandwagon to oppose it is because they are not going to gain anything from it. They are happy to deny those who might gain something from it.  Sometime back someone compared free basics to a free hit of drugs and it was upvoted wildly. That is as bad as bad analogies can be. Internet is extremely beneficial. Even for the poorest of the poor spending a 100 rupees a month  it is going to be beneficial once they learn the benefits. Internet is a win win situation for everyone. How the fuck can someone compare it to drugs? In their blind hatred and wanting to sound cool and be an activist they are opposing free basics without even understanding it.  ::  Media may include social media  ::  People really really really like free stuff. It's the usual yada yada with talkign points from the ads including ganesh of course who is really banking upon FB for his internet to grow more veggies. Ive tagged them as wankers on RES.  ::  300cr trickle down effect?  ::  Nah lots of new users I think.    Edit:Just read your comment again. And it kinda makes sense. Ads have certainly paid off I think. So yeah You are right  ::  Some of them seemed like paid shills. They only used to comment about free basics  no participation etc. Happened around facebook VP's ama.  ::  That's a big injection of foreign money in the Indian media industry.

Netflix will likely take years to see profits overseas  ,  That stock will turn around real fast if [Netflix] doesnt have something good to say about international growth  Tullo said. There was a global demand that they werent meeting  and right now they have the global content to make this move  he said. Tullo said this move  while it makes sense  makes Netflix a bit more of a risk and elevates expectations to a high level.
