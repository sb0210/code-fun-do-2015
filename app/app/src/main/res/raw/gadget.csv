Apple first introduced Thunderbolt on the MacBook Pro in 2011 and has brought the technology to all its laptops  bar the new MacBook  over the years. "It's just such an adaptable port " Kevin Sather  director of systems marketing at Razer  a high-end PC maker  told Ars Technica. This means that devices can be "chained": A MacBook can plug into an external hard drive and a display out of one Thunderbolt port  for example.  ,  Business Insider  ,  Five years later  Thunderbolt is finally gaining some traction in PCs  ,  More traditional Thunderbolt docks  those that simply turn a single Thunderbolt port into an array of USB  Ethernet  and display ports  should also become increasingly popular. When Intel finally starts building Thunderbolt into its chipsets rather than requiring an additional controller chip  that should seal the deal and make Thunderbolt a mainstream port. Intel's decision to ride the USB Type-C wave seems to be reversing Thunderbolt's fortunes. And on Apple's side of the fence  a new lineup of MacBooks and MacBook Pros with Thunderbolt 3 and a new version of the Thunderbolt Display could be a potent combination. Docks like this are by no means new  but using Thunderbolt instead of USB or a proprietary connector provides more bandwidth and means broader compatibility.  ,  Ars Technica UK  ,  2It's like saying "This Chevy Malibu is basically a Tesla with a gas engine instead"  ::  Except without being a Macbook  running OSX  or shipping with Apple Care...try again next time? , 0.367959450119 , 2It's like saying "This Chevy Malibu is basically a Tesla with a gas engine instead" , Except without being a Macbook  running OSX  or shipping with Apple Care...try again next time?
Get Tough on Drones Before People Die  ,  On Dec. 17 the FAA released a fact sheet outlining how it would regulate both recreational and commercial drones. Right outside the Variety Store a small drone crashed and burned on the sidewalkluckily not hitting anybody. Be in no doubt  a small drone ingested into a jet engine or striking a control surface at a critical moment could bring down the airplane. Recreational drones are also supposed not to fly above 400 feet and always remain in sight of the operator. Just how political and commercial interests intersect with professional obligations within the agency has never been easy to unravel  but drones have brought into play numerous pressures with different and sometimes contradictory interests.  ,  Daily Beast  ,  Drones Aren't Just Toys Anymore  ,  Anymore  the most important drones of tomorrow arent the ones you find on Amazon. The growth has actually been the same for the last three years in this particular industry  says Gartner analyst Gerald Van Hoy. Cars  ground drones  underwater robots; theyre all pretty much cousins.This is also  for what its worth  why Intel bought its drone company. There are racing drones that dont fly  and winged drones that fly very fast. Once companies know for sure when and how drones are allowed to operate  theyll start finding ways drones can make their lives easier.  ,  WIRED  ,  Toledo Blade  ,  A chilling recent account in the Washington Post detailed interference that military operations face from toy drones. Reports by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Armed Forces indicate that on 35 occasions  small drones came dangerously close to military aircraft or airfields. Then there was the alarming study last month that documented 241 close encounters in two years between drones and manned aircraft. Under the regulations  the owners of even toy drones that weigh more than a half-pound must mark their aircraft with a serial number and register it with the government. Yet the reports of so many drone encounters prove the difficulty of regulating use of the little machines.  ,  Toledo Blade  ,  Airport makes Williston a caution zone for drones  ,  AdvertisementAirport makes Williston a caution zone for dronesAdvertisementWILLISTON  N.D.  If youre planning to fly a drone in the Williston city limits  your first call had better be to airport manager Steven Kjergaard. Likewise  some drones will go a thousand or so feet up in the air  but FAA rules require drones to stay below 400 feet. If you buy one for a child  be prepared to enforce safety rules. They are near an airport  so especially in town  it is wise to be cautious and mindful of that  Kjergaard said. Perhaps the biggest change for the year is a requirement to register drones weighing more than 55 pounds with the FAA.  ,  Grand Forks Herald  ,  8This title is kinda dumb.

Is Oculus Rift's $600 Price Too High For Virtual Reality To Succeed?  ,  Is Oculus Rift's $600 Price Too High For Virtual Reality To Succeed? But will the Rift price tag doom the headset and perhaps even the much-hyped but yet-to-materialize virtual reality revolution? Oculus had just announced the price of its highly anticipated consumer model of the virtual reality headset Rift: $599. Of course  no one knows for sure if consumers will take to virtual reality.

Hopefully no one from inception joins the team.   ::  This reminds me of that time I had that dream me and Xzibit were watching inception in my car inside his car  ::  I really hate the whole preorder thing  alongside early access games and kickstarters. Show me a real product that works and maybe I'll consider throwing some money at it if it'll arrive in 3 to 5 business days.   ::  Well at least preordering this makes sense as its a physical product that a lot of people want :P But digitally distributed games on the other hand...  ::  You don't get charged until it ships  so if you really want one bad enough  you can get one. Digital software pre-orderingis stupid because there is no limit to supply.   ::  That's a little bit more expensive than I would have hoped.   ::  I paid around $500 for the DK2  i'm not surprised that the CV1 is this expensive.   ::  You have to have a GTX 970 ~~minimum~~ recommended unless you want a nausea simulator. This is not for those people of the so called PC master race with their mid range budget build from years gone by. This is for the highest end computers only. For that crowd this is not that expensive.  ::  Yeah right. I have a GTX970. $599 is enough that I'll wait and see how it goes. I also deploy later this year and they said the development cycle would be short. Probably wait it out until next generation.  ::  Not the highest end computers  the higher end graphics cards.  CPU isn't going to be much of an issue.  Anyone with a semi-modern system can upgrade their video to be good enough.  ::  > You have to have a GTX 970 minimum.  I don't know why everybody is suddenly saying this.  The 970 is "recommended".  This is no different than any computer game in the last 30 years.  There's a recommended  but it's not needed to run.  If somebody doesn't mind lower settings  then they're good to go.  ::  [deleted]  ::  That's recommended specs. For a consistently smooth experience. Doesn't mean you can't go below that.  ::  Tell that to /r/oculus they are losing their minds atm.  ::  But I worked my ass off for my 970 :(  ::  I'm not sure what people really expected.  Sure  they said they wanted it to be less than $500  but desires and reality don't always match up.  High end cell phones cost more than $599 (most just pay for it in monthly installments). This is first-generation technology  I think everyone should have expected it to come at a premium price.    For reference  the first iPod (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Classic#1st_generation) was released at a price point of $399  a year later  they offered a new version for $499.    The iPod was revolutionary when it comes to music  and the Rift *could* be revolutionary when it comes to gaming/VR.  ::  > High end cell phones cost more than $599  But I am very confident I will get $600 worth of use out of a smart phone. I know there is a ton of software that works out-of-the-box and contains a ton of easy-to-use features. The Rift may or may not have good software and may or may not be easy to use.  ::  If you're not confident that it'll be worth the price tag  don't buy it. This is not a product that casual gamers will want to purchase  the same way I don't feel inclined to purchase a high-end golf club because  to me  it's not worth the price tag.  ::  I don't see how you think casual gamers wouldn't want to purchase this. You don't have to be an amazing gamer to appreciate this product  but the price tag certainly will make plenty of people halt.   ::  Rift has good software and is easy to use as of dk2. Havent tried cv1.  ::  And the high price tag means there will be less software. It's really bad for indie devs.  ::  The Rift is only a display for the work that your required $1000+ computer is doing  though. A bit different to compare this to a standalone iPod or iPhone.  ::  And  how much does a decent  simple desktop monitor cost?  Something they sell in the tens of millions?  Without any complex and new development?  Without head-mounting hardware  tracking electronics and other bits?  The complaints on price are way off base.  If they "said $350" _not knowing_ they'd need to sell it at more  than I say no harm no foul.  ::  A computer that can run a current gen game on the oculus specs will cost a lot more than just $1000. My pc is worth roughly double that  and I'd be very surprised if it could generate 1 frame for every 2 refresh cycles.  ::  > Sure  they said they wanted it to be less than $500  To be fair  I haven't been following development. But last thing I heard they said they wanted it to be $350. $600 is a _lot_ more than $350.  > I'm not sure what people really expected.  I guess they expected it to be the price they were told it was going to be? Or at least in the same area as the dev kits. Right now I am kicking myself for not buying the dev kit. Yes  the quality is much lower but I simply don't have $600.  ::  This. This is the problem.   The price in and of itself is not terrible considering the technology involved. This is probably right around what most initially expected.

Could start a conversation and ask what it is OP does instead? Lets all practice being less judgmental today.   ::  Sorry if that came across as bragging. I've busted my ass as a small business owner. I used to deliver coffee for the people above me and hated every second. Now I deliver coffee to my employees and love every second of it.   ::  What type of production work do you do?  ::  Yeah one of the production companies i used to work for were looking into something similar- the Nolab Digital Super 8 Cartridge so you could convert a Super 8 camera to digital. Cool idea but can't find much info on it.  ::  I don't know anything about the subject really  but they all seemed to know what they were talking about. Playing on the need to be different and the magic of analogue  and directing that at students  seems like a really smart move. I wouldn't bet on them selling shiploads  but I don't see why this couldn't carve out a nice niche for itself.  ::  Was there any mention of expected price? I scanned through but didn't see anything  ::  This is broad  but I saw on another thread that the camera is $400-$700 and film (+processing) under $100. I think $60  but I don't remember exactly.   ::  Super8 cameras  film and processing never went away. These tools have been at your disposal for the last 40 years.   ::  Pros have been asking this for years. This is not for the consumer market.   ::  Kind of odd that they showed this at the Consumer Electronics Show.  Consumer is the **first** word.  ::  Yeah but I'm a hobbyist and cut my teeth on double 8mm in the late 90's early 2000's just for the hell of it.  I shot very little super 8 but I did stop for a while.  I'm ready to start again  hope they fix the jitter issue in the new camera. Frappin plastic cartridges   ::  Every single point in your post may be true  but the last time Kodak "knew their market" they went bankrupt.   Full disclosure: I'm a huge fan of Kodak and have a bunch of film and developing chemicals in the freezer for.... eventually. Bought it when they were going under.  ::  TS  they understood their market just fine  the mistake was inventing then shelving the digital camera to protect their cash cow. I'm a bigger fan than most  I was there and I bled yellow. The mighty EK with thirteen miles of manufacturing and privately owned fire departments on each end is not going to be a Phoenix rising from their self made ash pile.  ::  I agree with you mostly and love Rochester but wouldn't you say stubbornly refusing that digital was going to "win" for like 20 years straight a HUGE failure in understanding their market? I know a couple engineers and people that worked there from my crazy hanging on to film (they love talking this stuff)  but even they'd say that much.  ::  It was senior management denial more than confusion. I sat in one meeting where they said "fifty percent of the world has yet to take it's first photos". They actually naively thought they could introduce film into undeveloped markets and it would be accepted ahead of emerging digital. Additionally  they thought high resolution displays were decades away from where they were. If you spoke up it was not appreciated. They sold MANY great divisions that went on to be profitable lines of business after the sale. HSD  now Carestream is one such division  Tennessee Eastman chemicals was another error of a sale.  ::  And ironically  algorithms can duplicate film aberrations to a level undistinguishable from the real thing.   ::  [deleted]  ::  I quit loving Kodak decades ago when they thought the best way to compete was to litigate.  In the end  whatever is made with this film camera will have to be digitized if anyone other than the creator is to see it. The irony.   ::  I'd make the argument that when they went bankrupt  they didn't know their market. That's why they went bankrupt. They made a very serious miscalculation that film was never gonna go away  that digital was not a serious contender. Remember  they had digital technology decades before anyone else. They shelved it because film was a cash cow. Had they actually "known their market"  they would have been at the forefront of digital and their would be a tiny Kodak camera in every smartphone in the world  and canon and Nikon would be playing catch up to them  ::  And here I had just been thinking of trying to find an old super 8. Really cool.   ::  What the difference between a recording with a dslr and a super 8?  ::  You mean DSLR?  ::  Thanks for clearing that up! I was totally lost without the capitalization. I thought for a minute he just jammed his fingers randomly on his keyboard.  ::  Well he originally said dsl camera but he revised his comment. So yeah.   ::  Well then sorry for being a dick!   ::  Quality depends on the lens  most people think that Mega-pixels are vital for quality but  if you have a crap lens  YOU HAVE CRAP. "GIGO"  garbage in  garbage out.  ::  You can put almost any lens to modern mirrorless cameras.  , 0.373050064646 ,  Super8 cameras  film and processing never went away. These tools have been at your disposal for the last 40 years. ,   And here I had just been thinking of trying to find an old super 8. Really cool.
